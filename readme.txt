First part of the program:
  Create and perform operations on a tree. Preorder was required, for every operation that is used (even if level order would be a lot easier.)
  4 files: Node, Stack, Tree, and main. All 4 files are put into 1 file after I coded everything - dzp1.cpp
Second part of the program:
  Make a tree of all possible cases for the popular game "Connect four". Print one way to win for the player red, and one way for the player blue.
  If it's possible, make certain player always win the game. 4 files again, at the end all 4 were put in one file - dzp2.cpp
